Add some color to your highlighting experience.
Change the font and background color when you highlight and choose which websites to apply this feature.

Ever get tired of that blue highlight? Wait no longer. With Highlighter+, you have the freedom to choose your highlight color! 
By adding our chrome extension, you will be able to select the color of the highlight and the font color you wish to use. 
We used Visual Studio Code along with json, javascript, and html to make our functional chrome extension.
We've made ourselves competitive by introducing new features that existent highlight customizing extensions do not offer!
For example, users can choose to have Highlighter+ turned off for specific websites (eg. nytimes.com).
Through this process, we are very proud to have improved on the user experience and look forward to seeing how else we might
expand this project.
